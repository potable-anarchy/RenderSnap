# RenderSnap Development Log

## Project Overview
RenderSnap is a Node.js web service that renders URLs as screenshots or PDFs, designed for AI agents and automated services that need visual page captures.

## Development Timeline

### Initial Setup (2025-07-08)
- ✅ Created Express.js server with JSON API
- ✅ Implemented Playwright integration for web rendering
- ✅ Set up modular architecture with separate files:
  - `index.js` - Express server setup
  - `routes.js` - API route handlers
  - `renderer.js` - Playwright rendering logic
- ✅ Added static file serving for generated outputs
- ✅ Configured for Node.js 18+ compatibility

### Core Features Implemented
- ✅ **POST /render** endpoint for URL rendering
- ✅ **PNG screenshot capture** (full-page)
- ✅ **PDF generation** from web pages
- ✅ **Static file serving** via `/output/` route
- ✅ **Error handling** for missing URL parameter
- ✅ **File management** with timestamped filenames

### Deployment Configuration
- ✅ Vercel deployment setup with `vercel.json`
- ✅ Fixed legacy `builds` configuration issue
- ✅ Multiple successful deployments to Vercel
- ⚠️ **Current Issue**: Vercel Authentication enabled at team level

### Testing & Validation
- ✅ Local testing successful - renders example.com correctly
- ✅ API endpoints responding as expected
- ✅ File generation and serving working
- ✅ Error handling validated

## Current Status

### What's Working
- Local development server runs on port 3000
- API accepts POST requests with URL and optional type parameter
- Playwright successfully renders web pages
- Generated files are served via static routes
- Vercel deployment pipeline is functional

### Current Deployment
- **Production URL**: `https://render-snap-6xfbvzz1j-bradtacos-projects.vercel.app`
- **Status**: Protected by Vercel Authentication (team security setting)
- **Testing**: Local functionality confirmed working

### Known Issues
1. **Vercel Authentication**: Team-level security setting prevents public access
2. **No Request Validation**: Beyond basic URL requirement
3. **No Rate Limiting**: Could be exploited in production
4. **No Authentication**: API is completely open when accessible

## Technical Architecture

### Dependencies
- `express@^5.1.0` - Web framework
- `playwright@^1.53.2` - Web scraping and rendering

### File Structure
```
rendersnap/
├── index.js          # Express server setup
├── renderer.js       # Playwright rendering logic  
├── routes.js         # API route handlers
├── output/           # Generated files directory
├── package.json      # Dependencies and scripts
├── vercel.json       # Vercel deployment config
└── README.md         # Project documentation
```

### API Design
- **Endpoint**: `POST /render`
- **Input**: JSON with `url` (required) and `type` (optional: "png" or "pdf")
- **Output**: JSON with `success` and `fileUrl` properties
- **File Access**: `GET /output/{filename}`

## Development Notes

### Deployment Commands
```bash
# Deploy to Vercel
npx vercel --prod

# Local development
npm start

# Test API
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/render \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://example.com", "type": "png"}'
```

### Configuration Files
- `vercel.json` - Simplified to use Vercel's auto-detection
- `package.json` - Node.js 18+ requirement specified
- No middleware or authentication currently implemented

## Future Improvements
- [ ] Add request validation and sanitization
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Add authentication/API keys
- [ ] Resolve Vercel authentication issue
- [ ] Add request logging
- [ ] Implement file cleanup for old renders
- [ ] Add support for custom viewport sizes
- [ ] Add support for custom wait times
- [ ] Implement health check endpoint

## Lessons Learned
1. Vercel's legacy `builds` configuration should be avoided
2. Team-level security settings can override project settings
3. Playwright works well in serverless environments
4. Static file serving requires proper route configuration
5. Local testing is essential before deployment troubleshooting
